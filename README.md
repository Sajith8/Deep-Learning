# üå± Soybean Seed Classification & Oil Yield Estimation

A deep learning‚Äìpowered web application that classifies soybean seeds and estimates their potential oil yield based on seed type and batch weight. This project combines **CNN-based image classification** with a **Flask web interface**, offering an interactive and educational tool for agriculture and research use.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze soybean seed quality and predict their oil yield percentage. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies images of soybean seeds into categories such as:

- **Intact**
- **Broken**
- **Immature**
- **Skin-Damaged**
- **Spotted**

Based on the classification, an **oil yield calculator** estimates the expected oil content for a given batch weight.

## üî¨ Oil Yield Information

| Soybean Type | Expected Oil Content (% by weight) | Reasoning |
|---------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| Intact | 18‚Äì21% (Highest) | Fully mature and undamaged seeds retain maximum oil. |
| Broken | 17‚Äì20% | Slight loss due to physical damage; oil % stays similar. |
| Immature | 12‚Äì16% (Lowest) | Immature seeds haven‚Äôt fully developed storage lipids. |
| Skin-Damaged | 16‚Äì19% | Reduced due to exposure and moisture absorption. |
| Spotted | 17‚Äì20% | Cosmetic spots don‚Äôt drastically lower oil; slight quality drop possible. |

> **Key Insight:** Intact soybeans are ideal for oil extraction. Physical damage affects oil quality more than percentage.
